In this project, I’m learning Python from an online paid course, “100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.” 
This course is taught by Udemy instructor Dr. Angela Yu. You can check her profile here: https://www.udemy.com/user/4b4368a3-b5c8-4529-aa65-2056ec31f37e/
Through this course, I aim to master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days and learning data science, automation, web development, game development, and app development as a Python developer. 
You can see my coding practice solutions in the “tasks&solutions.py” files within each directory. For course assignments see "task.md" files.
